- [x] Fastest initial speed (500ms)
- [x] Fastest speed increase (40ms per round)
- [x] Lowest minimum speed (150ms - gets very fast)

### ✅ Core Game Mechanics
- [x] Sequence generation (random tile selection)
- [x] Sequence playback with visual feedback
- [x] User input tracking
- [x] Input validation (immediate feedback on wrong tile)
- [x] Round progression (sequence grows by 1 each round)
- [x] Game over detection
- [x] Score tracking (round number)
- [x] Restart functionality

### ✅ Technical Implementation
- [x] Clean separation of concerns:
  - ColorTile component for individual tiles
  - SimonSaysGenerator for game logic
  - SimonSaysGame for state management
- [x] Type safety with TypeScript
- [x] React hooks for state management
- [x] Proper cleanup of timeouts
- [x] Integration with existing game infrastructure
- [x] Unit tests for core logic

### ✅ User Experience
- [x] Visual feedback during sequence playback
- [x] Visual feedback when user presses tiles
- [x] Status messages to guide player
- [x] Disabled tiles during playback (prevents accidental taps)
- [x] End game modal integration
- [x] Difficulty parameter from route

## Implementation Details

### Speed Progression Example

**Easy Difficulty:**
- Round 1: 780ms per tile (800 - 20)
- Round 5: 700ms per tile (800 - 100)
- Round 20: 400ms per tile (min speed reached)
- Round 50: 400ms per tile (stays at minimum)

**Hard Difficulty:**
- Round 1: 460ms per tile (500 - 40)
- Round 5: 300ms per tile (500 - 200)
- Round 9: 150ms per tile (min speed reached)
- Round 50: 150ms per tile (stays at minimum)

### Color Palette
All 9 colors implemented:
1. Red (#FF4444 / #FF8888 active)
2. Blue (#4444FF / #8888FF active)
3. Green (#44FF44 / #88FF88 active)
4. Yellow (#FFFF44 / #FFFF88 active)
5. Purple (#AA44FF / #CC88FF active)
6. Orange (#FF8844 / #FFAA88 active)
7. Pink (#FF44AA / #FF88CC active)
8. Cyan (#44FFFF / #88FFFF active)
9. Lime (#AAFF44 / #CCFF88 active)

### Game Flow Verification

1. **Start Game**
   - Round set to 0
   - Sequence cleared
   - Game state: idle
   - Message: "Watch the sequence..."

2. **Round Start (Auto-triggered when state is idle)**
   - Round increments
   - New random tile added to sequence
   - Game state: showing
   - Sequence playback begins

3. **Sequence Playback**
   - Each tile in sequence lights up
   - Speed based on current round and difficulty
   - Flash duration: 60% of interval
   - Pause duration: 40% of interval

4. **User Input Phase**
   - Game state: input
   - Tiles enabled for pressing
   - Message: "Your turn! Repeat the sequence."
   - Each press validated immediately

5. **Correct Sequence**
   - Message: "Correct! Get ready for the next round..."
   - 1 second delay
   - Return to state: idle (triggers new round)

6. **Wrong Input**
   - Detected on first wrong tile
   - Game state: gameover
   - End game modal shown
   - Can restart with same or different difficulty

## Requirements Met ✅

All requirements from the problem statement have been successfully implemented:

1. ✅ **Multiple difficulties**: Easy, Medium, Hard
2. ✅ **Different boards per difficulty**: 4, 6, and 9 tiles respectively
3. ✅ **Easy mode slowest**: Confirmed with 800ms initial, 20ms decrease, 400ms min
4. ✅ **Speed increases with difficulty**: Hard has fastest initial (500ms) and decrease (40ms)
5. ✅ **Speed increases per round**: All difficulties speed up after each correct sequence
6. ✅ **More tiles in harder modes**: Easy=4, Medium=6, Hard=9
7. ✅ **No achievement tracking**: Explicitly excluded from implementation

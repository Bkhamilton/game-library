# Creating Original Games

## Overview

Developing original, unique games will demonstrate creativity and innovation to Apple's App Store review team. This document outlines concepts for original games that combine familiar mechanics in new ways or introduce entirely novel gameplay.

## Design Philosophy

Original games should:
- Be unique enough to distinguish the app from generic game collections
- Maintain the quality and polish of existing games
- Integrate with the existing scoring and achievement systems
- Be intuitive enough to learn quickly but deep enough for mastery

## Original Game Concepts

### 1. **Chrono Quest**

**Genre:** Time-Based Puzzle Adventure

**Unique Hook:** Players solve interconnected mini-puzzles where time spent on one puzzle affects the difficulty of subsequent puzzles.

**Gameplay Description:**
- Players face a sequence of 5-7 mini-challenges (word puzzles, number sequences, pattern matching)

- Completing puzzles quickly earns "time credits"
- Time credits can be spent to extend time on harder puzzles
- Strategic time management is key to completing the full quest

**Implementation Strategy:**
- Create a puzzle queue system
- Design 10-15 different mini-puzzle types
- Implement time banking and spending mechanics
- Add branching paths based on performance
- Include daily quest variations

**Scoring Metrics:**
| Metric Type | Description |
| ----------- | ----------- |
| Quest Completion | Whether full quest was completed |

| Stars Earned | Performance rating (1-3 stars) |

**What Makes It Original:**
- Gravity as a controllable game mechanic
- Physics-based puzzle solving
- Color mixing mechanics
- User-generated content potential

### 5. **Rhythm Memory**

**Genre:** Music-Based Memory Challenge

**Unique Hook:** Combine rhythm game mechanics with memory challenges—remember and recreate musical patterns.

**Gameplay Description:**
- Game plays a sequence of notes/beats
- Notes have both pitch (color) and timing (rhythm)
- Player must recreate both the sequence AND the rhythm
- Accuracy in timing matters as much as correct notes
- Progressive difficulty adds more instruments/voices
- Compose your own sequences to challenge friends

**Implementation Strategy:**
- Implement audio synthesis or use audio samples
- Create rhythm timing evaluation system
- Build note sequence recording and playback
- Add multiple instrument sounds
- Include visual representation of rhythm (note chart)

**Scoring Metrics:**
| Metric Type | Description |
| ----------- | ----------- |
| Rhythm Accuracy | Timing precision percentage |
| Note Accuracy | Correct note percentage |
| Perfect Performances | Flawless recreation of sequences |
| Longest Sequence | Maximum sequence length mastered |

**What Makes It Original:**
- Combines auditory and temporal memory
- Rhythm accuracy as core mechanic
- Musical creativity element
- Social sharing of custom sequences

**Gameplay Description:**
- Receive 8-12 story fragments (text cards)
- Arrange fragments in chronological order
- Multiple orderings may be valid (parallel storylines)
- Some fragments are red herrings (don't belong)
- Earn points based on narrative coherence (AI-evaluated)

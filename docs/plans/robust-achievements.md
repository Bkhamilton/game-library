# Robust Achievement System

## Overview

A comprehensive achievement system significantly increases app complexity, player engagement, and replay value. This document outlines strategies to expand and enhance the current achievement system.

## Current Achievement System

The app currently has:
- 6 basic achievements
- Simple criteria: first wins and score thresholds
- Binary completion (achieved or not achieved)
- No achievement categories or tiers

**Current Achievements:**
1. First Sudoku Win
2. First Minesweeper Win
3. First Word Search Win
4. First Crossword Win
5. Score 10 in Ostrich Haul
6. Score 10 in GoGoBird

## Enhancement Strategies

### 1. **Multi-Tier Achievement System**

**Concept:** Transform single achievements into progressive tiers (Bronze, Silver, Gold, Platinum, Diamond).

**Implementation:**

**Example: Sudoku Mastery Series**
```json
{
  "id": 101,
  "title": "Sudoku Novice",
  "tier": "Bronze",
  "description": "Win 5 Sudoku games",
  "criteria": {
    "game": "Sudoku",
    "metric": "result",
    "threshold": 5
  },
  "points": 10
},
{
  "id": 102,
  "title": "Sudoku Enthusiast",
  "tier": "Silver",
  "description": "Win 25 Sudoku games",
  "criteria": {
    "game": "Sudoku",
    "metric": "result",
    "threshold": 25
  },
  "points": 25
},
{
  "id": 103,
  "title": "Sudoku Expert",
  "tier": "Gold",
  "description": "Win 100 Sudoku games",
  "criteria": {
    "game": "Sudoku",
    "metric": "result",
    "threshold": 100
  },
  "points": 50
}
```

**Database Updates:**
```sql
ALTER TABLE Achievements ADD COLUMN tier TEXT;
ALTER TABLE Achievements ADD COLUMN points INTEGER DEFAULT 0;
ALTER TABLE Achievements ADD COLUMN icon TEXT;
```

**Benefits:**
- Long-term progression goals
- Rewards for continued play
- Clear achievement hierarchy
- More satisfying completion experience

---

### 2. **Achievement Categories**

**Concept:** Organize achievements into themed categories.

**Categories:**

#### **Completion Achievements**
- First Wins for each game
- Perfect Games (no mistakes)
- Speed Completions (under time threshold)
- Difficulty Mastery (win on hardest difficulty)

#### **Streak Achievements**
```json
{
  "id": 201,
  "title": "On Fire",
  "category": "Streak",
  "description": "Win 5 games in a row",
  "criteria": {
    "metric": "streak",
    "threshold": 5
  }
},
{
  "id": 202,
  "title": "Unstoppable",
  "category": "Streak",
  "description": "Win 10 games in a row",
  "criteria": {
    "metric": "streak",
    "threshold": 10
  }
}
```

#### **Collection Achievements**
- Win once on every game
- Get 3 stars on all levels (for applicable games)
- Unlock all difficulty settings
- Try every game mode

#### **Time-Based Achievements**
```json
{
  "id": 301,
  "title": "Speed Demon",
  "category": "Time",
  "description": "Complete Crossword in under 2 minutes",
  "criteria": {
    "game": "Crossword",
    "metric": "time",
    "threshold": 120,
    "operator": "less_than"
  }
}
```

#### **Score Achievements**
- High score milestones
- Total accumulated score across all games
- Single game score records

#### **Skill Achievements**
```json
{
  "id": 401,
  "title": "No Hints Needed",
  "category": "Skill",
  "description": "Win 10 games without using any hints",
  "criteria": {
    "metric": "noHints",
    "threshold": 10
  }
}
```

#### **Social/Competitive Achievements**
- Top 10% of players globally (if adding leaderboards)
- Beat daily challenge
- Achieve personal best

---

### 3. **Hidden Achievements**

**Concept:** Secret achievements that players discover through gameplay.

**Examples:**

```json
{
  "id": 501,
  "title": "Night Owl",
  "hidden": true,
  "description": "Play a game between midnight and 5 AM",
  "criteria": {
    "type": "special",
    "condition": "play_time_range",
    "start": "00:00",
    "end": "05:00"
  }
},
{
  "id": 502,
  "title": "Comeback Kid",
  "hidden": true,
  "description": "Win after losing 5 times in a row",
  "criteria": {
    "type": "special",
    "condition": "win_after_losses",
    "threshold": 5
  }
},
{
  "id": 503,
  "title": "Lucky Number Seven",
  "hidden": true,
  "description": "Win 7 different games in one day",
  "criteria": {
    "type": "special",
    "condition": "unique_games_one_day",
    "threshold": 7
  }
}
```

**Implementation:**
- Don't show achievement details until unlocked
- Provide subtle hints in achievement menu
- Create "?" placeholder icons

---

### 4. **Daily and Weekly Challenges**

**Concept:** Time-limited achievements that refresh regularly.

**Daily Challenges:**

  "id": "daily_2024_01_15",
  "title": "Daily Challenge",
  "description": "Complete 3 games today",
  "duration": "24h",
  "reward": {
    "points": 50,
    "badge": "daily_complete"
  },
  "criteria": {
    "gamesWon": 3,
    "timeframe": "today"
  }
}
```

**Weekly Challenges:**
```json
{
  "id": "weekly_2024_w3",
  "title": "Weekly Warrior",
  "description": "Win 25 games this week",
  "duration": "7d",
  "reward": {
    "points": 200,
    "badge": "weekly_warrior"
  },
  "criteria": {
    "gamesWon": 25,
    "timeframe": "this_week"
  }
}
```

**Database Schema:**
```sql
CREATE TABLE IF NOT EXISTS DailyChallenges (
  id TEXT PRIMARY KEY,
  title TEXT NOT NULL,
  description TEXT NOT NULL,
  startDate DATE NOT NULL,
  endDate DATE NOT NULL,
  criteria TEXT NOT NULL,
  reward TEXT NOT NULL
);

CREATE TABLE IF NOT EXISTS UserChallenges (
  userId INTEGER NOT NULL,
  challengeId TEXT NOT NULL,
  progress INTEGER DEFAULT 0,
  completed BOOLEAN DEFAULT 0,
  completedAt DATETIME,
  FOREIGN KEY (userId) REFERENCES Users(id),
  FOREIGN KEY (challengeId) REFERENCES DailyChallenges(id)
);
```

### 5. **Achievement Points and Rewards**

**Concept:** Assign point values to achievements and use points for rewards.

**Point System:**
- Bronze achievements: 10 points
- Silver achievements: 25 points
- Gold achievements: 50 points

| 250 | Unlock avatar customization |
| 500 | Unlock "Elite" player badge |
| 1000 | Unlock exclusive game modes |
| 2500 | Unlock special particle effects |
| 5000 | "Legendary" player status |

**Database Schema:**
```sql
CREATE TABLE IF NOT EXISTS UserAchievements (
  userId INTEGER NOT NULL,
  achievementId INTEGER NOT NULL,
  unlockedAt DATETIME DEFAULT CURRENT_TIMESTAMP,
  FOREIGN KEY (userId) REFERENCES Users(id),
  FOREIGN KEY (achievementId) REFERENCES Achievements(id),
  UNIQUE(userId, achievementId)
);

CREATE TABLE IF NOT EXISTS UserRewards (
  userId INTEGER NOT NULL,
  rewardId INTEGER NOT NULL,
  unlockedAt DATETIME DEFAULT CURRENT_TIMESTAMP,
  FOREIGN KEY (userId) REFERENCES Users(id)
);

ALTER TABLE Users ADD COLUMN totalPoints INTEGER DEFAULT 0;
```

  category: string;
  points: number;
  progress: number;
  total: number;
  unlocked: boolean;
  unlockedAt?: Date;

## Technical Considerations

### Code Organization
- Create new component folders under `components/Home/` for each game
- Follow existing pattern: `GameName/GameNameGame.tsx`
- Add game data to `data/games.json`
- Update database schema if new metric types are needed

### Asset Requirements
- Game-specific sprites and images
- Sound effects for audio-enabled games (Simon Says)
- Card graphics for card games (Solitaire, Memory Match)

### Testing
- Test each game on different difficulty levels
- Ensure score tracking works correctly
- Verify achievement triggers function properly
- Test on both iOS and Android devices

### Performance
- Optimize rendering for grid-based games
- Use React Native animations efficiently
- Implement proper cleanup on component unmount

## Database Schema Updates

Add new games to the Games table:

```sql
INSERT INTO Games (id, title, description) VALUES 
(7, '2048', 'Combine tiles to reach 2048'),
(8, 'Solitaire', 'Classic card game of patience'),
(9, 'Memory Match', 'Find matching pairs of cards'),
(10, 'Connect Four', 'Connect four discs in a row'),
(11, 'Nonogram', 'Reveal pictures using number clues'),
(12, 'Tetris', 'Arrange falling blocks to clear lines'),
(13, 'Simon Says', 'Repeat the pattern sequence');
```

## User Experience Impact

Adding more games will:
- Increase daily active usage time
- Provide more variety to keep users engaged
- Appeal to different player preferences (strategy vs. memory vs. action)
- Create more opportunities for achievements and progression
- Demonstrate significant content expansion for App Store review

## Next Steps

1. Select 2-3 games from Phase 1 to implement first
2. Design UI mockups for selected games
3. Create detailed implementation specifications
4. Implement games following existing code patterns
5. Add corresponding achievements
6. Test thoroughly before submission
7. Update marketing materials to highlight game variety

# Animation Libraries Phase 1 - Pull Request Summary

## Overview

This PR implements **Phase 1: Animation Libraries** from the Improved Visuals Plan. It installs, configures, and documents three key animation libraries that will enable smooth animations, particle effects, and complex visual feedback across the game library.

## What Was Done

### 1. Library Installation ✅

Three animation libraries were installed and configured:

| Library | Version | Purpose |
|---------|---------|---------|
| react-native-reanimated | v4.1.2 | 60fps native animations |
| lottie-react-native | v7.3.4 | Complex vector animations |
| react-native-confetti-cannon | v1.5.2 | Particle effects |

### 2. Configuration ✅

#### Babel Configuration
Created `babel.config.js` with proper plugin ordering:
```javascript
module.exports = function(api) {
  api.cache(true);
  return {
    presets: ['babel-preset-expo'],
    plugins: [
      'react-native-reanimated/plugin', // Must be last!
    ],
  };
};
```

#### Expo Configuration
Updated `app.json` to include reanimated plugin:
```json
"plugins": [
  "expo-router",
  "expo-font",
  "expo-sqlite",
  "expo-web-browser",
  "react-native-reanimated/plugin"
]
```

### 3. Example Components ✅

Created comprehensive example components demonstrating each library:

#### React Native Reanimated Examples
- `AnimatedButton` - Press animation with spring physics

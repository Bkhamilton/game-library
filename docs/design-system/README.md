# Game Library Design System

Welcome to the Game Library Design System documentation. This design system provides a comprehensive guide for implementing consistent, accessible, and visually appealing interfaces across all games in the library.

## Overview

The design system is built to support the improved visuals plan (Phase 1 implementation) and serves as a reference for current and future development. It ensures visual consistency, accessibility, and maintainability across the entire application.

## Documentation Structure

This design system is organized into the following sections:

### [01. Theme System](./01-themes.md)
Complete documentation of the theme system, including all 5 themes (Light, Dark, Retro, Nature, Neon), the GameTheme interface, and implementation patterns.

### [02. Typography System](./02-typography.md)
Font hierarchy, sizing, weights, and usage guidelines for all typography levels (title, header, body, caption).

### [03. Color System](./03-colors.md)
Comprehensive color palette documentation, usage guidelines, accessibility considerations, and contrast ratios for all themes.

### [04. Component Design Guidelines](./04-components.md)
Design specifications for buttons, cards, inputs, grids, and other UI components with states and variations.

### [05. Animation Guidelines](./05-animations.md)
Animation patterns, timing functions, duration standards, and performance considerations for micro-interactions and transitions.

### [06. Game-Specific Visual Standards](./06-game-visuals.md)
Visual specifications, layout standards, and interaction patterns tailored for each game type in the library.

## Getting Started

### For Developers

1. Review the [Theme System](./01-themes.md) to understand how themes are implemented
2. Familiarize yourself with [Typography](./02-typography.md) and [Colors](./03-colors.md) for consistent styling
3. Reference [Component Guidelines](./04-components.md) when building UI elements
4. Follow [Animation Guidelines](./05-animations.md) for smooth, performant interactions
5. Check [Game-Specific Standards](./06-game-visuals.md) when working on individual games

### For Designers

1. Use this documentation as a reference for design decisions
2. Ensure all designs comply with accessibility standards outlined in the Color System
3. Follow component specifications for consistency across the application
4. Reference existing patterns before creating new ones

## Key Principles

### 1. Consistency
- Use established patterns and components across all games
- Maintain consistent spacing, sizing, and visual hierarchy
- Follow theme guidelines for color usage

### 2. Accessibility
- Ensure all color combinations meet WCAG AA standards (4.5:1 contrast ratio minimum)
- Support reduced motion preferences
- Provide clear visual feedback for all interactions
- Maintain readable font sizes (minimum 12px)

### 3. Performance
- Optimize animations for 60fps
- Use native driver for animations when possible
- Minimize re-renders through proper React optimization
- Lazy load assets when appropriate

### 4. Flexibility
- Design for multiple themes and customization
- Support different screen sizes and orientations
- Allow for easy addition of new games and features
- Build reusable, composable components

## Implementation Guidelines

### Theme Usage

```typescript
import { useThemeContext } from '@/contexts/ThemeContext';

function MyComponent() {
  const { currentTheme } = useThemeContext();
  
  return (
    <View style={{ backgroundColor: currentTheme.colors.background }}>
      <Text style={{ color: currentTheme.colors.text }}>Hello World</Text>
    </View>
  );
}
```

### Typography Usage

```typescript
const styles = StyleSheet.create({
  title: {
    fontFamily: 'Poppins-Bold',
    fontSize: 32,
    fontWeight: 'bold',
  },
  body: {
    fontFamily: 'Inter-Regular',
    fontSize: 16,
    fontWeight: 'normal',
  },
});
```

## Contributing to the Design System

When adding new patterns or components:

1. Ensure they work across all 5 themes
2. Document usage examples and edge cases
3. Include accessibility considerations
4. Test on multiple screen sizes
5. Update relevant documentation sections

## Feedback and Updates

This design system is a living document. As the game library evolves, this documentation should be updated to reflect new patterns, components, and best practices.

For questions or suggestions, please refer to the main project repository.

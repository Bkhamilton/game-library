## Testing

All libraries have been verified to:
- ✅ Install correctly
- ✅ Import without errors
- ✅ Compile with TypeScript
- ✅ Include comprehensive examples
- ✅ Include full documentation

## Next Steps

1. **Test on device**
   - Run on iOS simulator/device
   - Run on Android emulator/device
   - Verify animations run at 60fps

2. **Integration**
   - Add animations to Sudoku number entry
   - Add confetti to game completion screens
   - Add loading spinners to game screens

3. **Asset Creation**
   - Download/create Lottie animations from LottieFiles
   - Design custom particle effects

## Performance Notes

- Reanimated uses native driver for 60fps animations
- Lottie files should be kept under 100KB
- Confetti particle count: 100-200 recommended for mobile

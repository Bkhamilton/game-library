# Simon Says Implementation Summary

## Overview
This document describes the implementation of the Simon Says memory game with three difficulty levels.

## Game Mechanics

### Core Gameplay Loop
1. **Showing Sequence**: Game displays a sequence of colored tiles that light up one at a time
2. **User Input**: Player must repeat the sequence by tapping the tiles in the correct order
3. **Validation**: Game validates each tap immediately (fails on first wrong tile)
4. **Round Progression**: If correct, a new tile is added to the sequence and the next round begins
5. **Game Over**: If player taps the wrong tile, the game ends

### Difficulty Levels

| Difficulty | Tiles | Grid Layout | Initial Speed | Speed Decrease | Min Speed |
|------------|-------|-------------|---------------|----------------|-----------|
| Easy       | 4     | 2x2         | 800ms         | 20ms/round     | 400ms     |
| Medium     | 6     | 2x3         | 600ms         | 30ms/round     | 250ms     |
| Hard       | 9     | 3x3         | 500ms         | 40ms/round     | 150ms     |

### Speed Progression
- Each round, the playback speed decreases by the specified amount
- Speed never goes below the minimum threshold
- Hard difficulty speeds up the fastest, making it more challenging

### Color Tiles
Available colors (in order):
1. Red (#FF4444)
2. Blue (#4444FF)
3. Green (#44FF44)
4. Yellow (#FFFF44)
5. Purple (#AA44FF)
6. Orange (#FF8844)
7. Pink (#FF44AA)
8. Cyan (#44FFFF)
9. Lime (#AAFF44)

## Implementation Details

### File Structure
```
components/Home/SimonSays/
  ├── SimonSaysGame.tsx       # Main game component
  └── ColorTile.tsx           # Individual tile component

utils/
  └── SimonSaysGenerator.ts   # Game logic and utilities

components/__tests__/
  └── SimonSaysGenerator-test.js  # Unit tests
```

### Key Components

#### SimonSaysGame.tsx
Main game component that manages:
- Game state (idle, showing, input, gameover)
- Sequence generation and storage
- User input tracking
- Round progression
- Visual feedback during playback

#### ColorTile.tsx
Reusable tile component with:
- Color theming
- Active/inactive states
- Touch handling
- Disabled state during playback

#### SimonSaysGenerator.ts
Utility functions for:
- Difficulty settings
- Sequence generation
- Speed calculations
- Input validation
- Color management

### Game State Flow

```
START GAME
    ↓
[IDLE] → Generate new round
    ↓
[SHOWING] → Playback sequence
    ↓
[INPUT] → Wait for user input
    ↓
Check input → Correct? → Back to [IDLE]
    ↓
  Wrong
    ↓
[GAMEOVER] → Show modal
```

### Validation Strategy
The game uses **partial sequence validation** (`checkPartialSequence`):
- Validates each user input immediately as it's entered
- Fails immediately on the first wrong tile (no need to wait for full sequence)
- This provides instant feedback to the player

## Testing
Unit tests cover:
- Difficulty settings validation
- Tile color generation
- Sequence generation and immutability
- Speed calculations (including minimum speed enforcement)
- Sequence matching (full and partial)

## Integration
The game integrates with existing infrastructure:
- Uses `EndGameMessage` modal for game over screen
- Supports difficulty parameter via route
- Follows existing game component patterns
- Compatible with theme system

## Future Enhancements (Not Implemented)
- Audio feedback for tile presses
- Achievement tracking
- High score persistence
- Animations for tile highlights
- Vibration feedback on mobile

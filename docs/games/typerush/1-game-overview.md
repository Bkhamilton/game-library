# TypeRush - Game Overview

## Core Concept

**TypeRush** merges the addictive, fast-paced gameplay of Temple Run with the skill-building benefits of a typing trainer. Players navigate an endless running course where obstacles can only be avoided by typing the correct characters or sequences at the right moment. This creates a unique gaming experience where improved typing skills directly translate to better game performance.

```

#### 2. Beginner-Friendly Onboarding

**Traditional:**
- Start with absolute basics
- No pressure or time limits
- Can repeat lessons indefinitely
- Clear progression path

**TypeRush:**
- Assumes basic keyboard familiarity
- Time pressure from the start

Session 4: Skip (too boring)
```

**TypeRush:**
```
Session 1: 20 minutes (fun!)
Session 2: 25 minutes (getting better!)
Session 3: 30 minutes (beat high score!)
Session 4+: Regular play (addicting)
```

**Analysis:** Fun gameplay drives consistent practice, leading to better long-term outcomes.

#### 3. Real-World Speed Training

**Traditional Approach:**
- Practice predetermined texts
- Focus on accuracy over speed
- Gradual, controlled progression

**TypeRush Approach:**
- High-pressure, time-limited inputs
- Must type fast to succeed
- Natural speed progression
